# Yni Viar original SCP assets
## About
Assets, created by Yni Viar, since 2023.
⚠️ Models are adapted for game engines (specifically Godot), since they were used in my games. For render, you need to manually add lights.
⚠️ Room scale is 20.48 x 20.48, as in Containment Breach and pre-Mimicry SCP:SL
